# WaniKani-ElementaryDark

A bottom-up, backwards-compatible redesign of the original [WKElementaryDark](https://github.com/Sepitus-exe/WKElementaryDark), rewritten entirely using SASS. This version focuses on maintainability, customization, and modern CSS practices while preserving the look and feel of the original.

Wherever possible, this custom stylesheet attempts to hijack and override the native CSS variables defined by the website, ensuring sturdier, more uniform look in face of unforseen changes to the site.
