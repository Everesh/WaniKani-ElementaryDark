# WaniKani-ElementaryDark

WaniKani-ElementaryDark is a bottom-up, backwards-compatible redesign of the original [WKElementaryDark](https://github.com/Sepitus-exe/WKElementaryDark) theme. Rewritten entirely using SASS, this version focuses on maintainability, customization, and modern CSS practices while preserving the look and feel of the original.
